# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview:
- This project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.
- The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived or not based on various features available in the dataset.

Features:
1. Dataset: Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes features such as Age, Sex, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked.
2. Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, and model training.
3. Models Implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.

Key Technologies:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
